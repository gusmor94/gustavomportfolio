# Portfolio (Gustavo Morales)

## Description
This repository contains the code to my [portfolio](https://gusmor94.github.io/gustavomportfolio/) as a web developer. As of right now I am in te first stages of my development career, so the deployed url looks a bit bare, however, as time goes on, and I expand my repertoire, this repository will be updated to represent the current state of my ability. 

I struggled a bit with the CSS styling of this portfolio, because I am still trying to get used to flexbox and CSS grid, as well as the adjustments for media queries in order to make the webpage properly responsive. One thing that assisted me was looking back at previous code where the flexbox and css grid properties were functioning, and seeing how I could apply it to this situation. 

As you can see below, I have only completed one form of work at the moment, which is located in the "portfolio" section, but in time we will see more examples displayed.
